Quotes from The Bro Code (a tie-in book from the TV Series - How I Met Your Mother)

== Description ==
Smile everytime you login to your Wordpress Admin dashboard as your wingman displays a random Bro Code article in your dashboard. 
<em>Quote style inspired by <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/07/25/modern-block-quote-styles/">Tympanus</a>. Style enqueue using a tutorial by <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/adding-custom-widgets-to-the-wordpress-admin-dashboard/">wpmudev</a></em>

== Installation ==
Upload the zip file and activate the plugin from the dashboard. It is as simple as that.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: The Wingman widget appears at the bottom of the admin dashboard
A: If you have never re-arranged your widgets, the plugin will automatically move your wingman to the top of the heap. If you have already re-arranged your widgets, you will have to manually move the widget to the location of choice.

Q: I am having technical errors/error in widget activation
A: Raise a support ticket or drop a note at http://thecodeisclear.in/reach-out/. I will work on it as soon as I can. Please mention other plugins that you have active and if possible a screenshot of the error.

Q: There is a spelling error in the text
A: I have used the original text from The Bro Code. There could be some errors in transcription. Email me and I will update the text in the next version
